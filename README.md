# lua-chess
A chess clone built in lua

Currently this chess clone is incomplete and is missing many features.  
-There game does not check if you are in check or checkmate. The game only ends when the king is dead.  
-There is no castling or en passant  
-There is no settings although the game does still work properly if the window size is changed in the code  
-There is only local play with other humans. No bots yet  
-There is only the screen with the chess board
